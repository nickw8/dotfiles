# Purpose: This file is sourced for all shell sessions, including login, interactive, and non-interactive shells i.e. Universal environment settings.
# Use: It is typically used to set environment variables that should be available to all types of shell sessions.
# Example: Setting the PATH variable or other environment variables that need to be universally accessible.

# Ensure that a non-login, non-interactive shell has a defined environment.
